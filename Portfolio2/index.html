                Both the element of belief and the art of storytelling are fluttering everywhere, all around us. Then…there I am, net in one hand, jar in the other, hunting—capturing as many variants of belief as I can, seeking as many angles to story as possible.

              <p>
                Here are pieces of my artwork, I aim to take deep detailed scenes as well as expressions and translate them into simple yet effective lines. Through the combination of primitive shapes along with motion and animation, I aim to strike curiosity in the hearts and through the eyes of my viewers through great mystery and racy action!

                My goal is to learn the fundamentals of the front and back end of the web and to work with others in building innovative, responsive apps, sites and stages that communicate well with users all around the world. My passion is to push the limits with the languages learned so that I can use my design, illustration and developing knowledge to direct great paths to solutions, and to learn advanced concept and mold them into simpler structures as well as grant great value in solving problems with any type of team size and or dynamic. 
              </p>
        
               <p>
                My passion is to create an app which tells stories in paneled increments which plays out in a variation of ways. Firstly, I want to learn the ins and outs to React, JavaScript and python in making interactive panel to panel stories, programmed illustrated animated and sound engineered by myself and a small team. This will extend to programming characters and settings in which a user can use to traverse the created world we create for them. I want to use this skill and power to be a director, not only for my own world--not only for the sake of art, but a director of all sorts of apps, sites and stages.
